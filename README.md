# Samebug Web Support

If you have a suggestion or an issue to report, please use the [Samebug issue tracker](https://github.com/samebug/samebug-support/issues).
We recommend that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This probably is the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add steps to reproduce the bug, browser version and OS version. Any additional files (console errors, screenshots) would be helpful. We have compiled a quick set of [guidelines for reporting issues](https://github.com/samebug/samebug-support#guidelines-for-reporting-issues).

## Guidelines for reporting issues

We have put together a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to our GitHub issue tracker. Following this should help speedy resolution of issues.

1. This issue tracker is only for Samebug web app related issues, along with other services accessible from the web. If you have plugin specific issues, a better place to report them would be the appropiate issue tracker of that plugin: [IntelliJ Idea plugin](https://github.com/samebug/samebug-idea-plugin/issues), [Android Studio](https://github.com/samebug/samebug-idea-plugin/issues).
2. If you are facing an issue related to your non-public workspace and you want to include private information such as your username, search or solution urls, then mail us at [support@samebug.io](mailto:support@samebug.io).
3. Answer to questions along the lines of "How do I... in Samebug" should be in our [technical documentation](https://github.com/samebug/technical-documentation#samebug). If you are unable to find a how-to guide in our online documentation, feel free to ask your question at [support@samebug.io](mailto:support@samebug.io).
4. Before reporting an issue use the search feature on the issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it is hard to keep track of them or respond when the issues are solved. If you find your issue already reported, feel free to add "+1" reaction and we will keep a note of it.
5. When reporting a new issue in the issue tracker, check whether it helps to answer the following questions:
 - Which Operating System and browser you are using. Please specify the version of your browser.
 - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally?
 - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?
 - If it is a UI issue, a screenshot or GIF will help tremendously.
